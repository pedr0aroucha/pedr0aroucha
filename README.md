<h1>🖖🏽 Hello World</h1>

<p> 
I have been working as a software developer since 2019, but I entered the programming world in 2017 when I was part of a school robotics team. To be more specific, I work as a full stack developer using the most famous technologies such as Javascript/Typescript with Node.js, Python, MySQL, Nginx, AWS, Docker and Kubernetes.

I've been a Linux enthusiast since 2017, I'm passionate about the OS and periodically study its ecosystem.

When I'm not at the computer working, studying or playing games, I'm playing sports, hanging out with friends, watching a series or hanging out with family.
