<h1>🖖🏽 Hello World</h1>

<p> 
I've been a software developer since 2019. I work in the market as a full satck developer using the most famous technologies such as javascript with nodejs, python, mysql, nginx and aws.

I've been a Linux enthusiast since 2017, I'm passionate about the OS and periodically study its ecosystem.

When I'm not at the computer working, studying or playing games, I'm playing sports, hanging out with friends, watching a series or hanging out with family.
